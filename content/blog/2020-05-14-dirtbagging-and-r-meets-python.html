<p>#The Last Two Months
<em>The past couple months have been very interesting to say the least. After spring break got extended an extra week, my buddy Robbie and I decided to extend our stay in Red Rock near Las Vegas another week to climb the sandstone. Halfway through the trip I received news that campus had been closed and all classes were to be moved remotely via Zoom. The official campsite right by Red Rock also shut down March 22nd due to the virus, so we decided to hold it out another week in an area a bit further away from Red Rock where we could dispersed camp and see if school was feasible on the road, using my car as my office/charging port and my phone as a hotspot. It ended up working out just fine even though there were many problems to figure out along the way. Some of these problems included where we were going to shower now that businesses were closed, where we would fill up water, where to efficiently buy groceries, and where to find better places to camp that were closer to Red Rock (which we eventually found due to word of mouth from other climbers). Staying in Las Vegas ended up being well worth it as all the classic lines people are often found waiting in line for or even worse ‘congalining’ were all empty since the Red Rock Scenic Loop that makes the conservation area easily accessible was closed. Long approaches of up to 2 hours became the norm on days we climbed, but the reward was getting to an area that is often just too busy and having it completely vacant. It truly felt like a once in a lifetime experience and we are glad we stayed in Vegas until it got too hot to continue. We are currently at Mount Lemmon just outside of Tucson, Arizona. Even though Tucson has high temperatures this time of year, Mount Lemmon consistently stays around 30 degrees cooler. Cragging along the Catalina Highway has been great as the approaches are much shorter and we do not have to take our tent down every morning. Packing in all our water for the week in a sedan along with packing out all of our trash back to Tucson gets tricky sometimes, but we make it work with a couple trips to town every week. It is nice to climb on the different rock here being granite as limestone is practically all there is in Austin besides the pink granite domes at Enchanted Rock. Even though commencement got delayed it was cool this situation came from it as I would have never anticipated dirtbagging my last semester of college</em></p>

<p>#R meets Python
<em>During my last semester for my computational biology class I spend lots of time learning the fundamentals of R, the various packages that make calculating statistics/creating plots much more efficient, and how to showcase these skills with data scavenged from the real world. It turned out to be one of the coolest classes I have taken at UT as it taught me how to exhaust my resources in order to find the answer to the question at stake. I quickly found what I liked so much about coding in R being that one does not have to learn everything at once or even in any particular order. It is rather all about finding what you need for a particular project, implementing it, and then being able to access the information next time to help with other projects. As I kept messing around with R I kept learning more and more about how to troubleshoot future problems quicker and more efficiently. It was cool to find something that could keep me busy without getting distracted for hours on end until I found the solution.</em></p>
<p><em>Just as R started to become something I felt much more “fluent” in, Python came around. At first Python seemed so much different than R. Indexing was new and weird as now the first character in an array was in the zeroth position, the syntax as much different, and the interface (even on Jupyterhub) was not as inviting as R Studio. It was cool to learn R before Python came into the picture though because it made understanding the new language easier to comprehend and adjust to. One of the coolest topics we learned was how to use regular expressions (Regex) to find and print sequences and patterns from a string. Regex is particularly important for data science since it allows one to extract for example URLs, numbers, IP addresses, names, etc. In genetics it has become increasingly important with DNA sequencing as a major tool for sorting through a given sequence. In the example below from one of the assignments this semester, I will show how Regex can be implemented for biological purposes.</em></p>
<p><em>In the string below we want to find the sites that match the enzyme binding sites for GCRWTG and ANTAAT where N is any base, R is A or G and W is A or T. The regex ‘findall’ operation was used to search the sequence for the enzyme binding sites of interest. For the first site ‘GCRWTG’ the first two bases had to be GC so that is why these bases are first in the expression. The next base could either be an A or G so ‘[]’ were used to search the string for GC followed by an A or G. The same goes for the next base as it had to be either an A or T. Since the last two bases were TG this was specified at the end of the expression for this first binding site. The ‘|’ was then used to search for another enzyme binding site ‘ANTAAT’. This was even more straight forward since the only base that could differ was the second where it could be any base. The ‘.’ was used to include any other character after A since N could be any nucleotide. The rest of the expression made it so that only the first two bases followed by TAAT would be included in the output. After running the code, the result was four fragments matching the criteria for the regular expression. </em></p>
