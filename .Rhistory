**R meets Python**
*During my last semester for my computational biology class I spend lots of time learning the fundamentals of R, the various packages that make calculating statistics/creating plots much more efficient, and how to showcase these skills with data scavenged from the real world. It turned out to be one of the coolest classes I have taken at UT as it taught me how to exhaust my resources in order to find the answer to the question at stake. I quickly found what I liked so much about coding in R being that one does not have to learn everything at once or even in any particular order. It is rather all about finding what you need for a particular project, implementing it, and then being able to access the information next time to help with other projects. As I kept messing around with R I kept learning more and more about how to troubleshoot future problems quicker and more efficiently. It was cool to find something that could keep me busy without getting distracted for hours on end until I found the solution.*
