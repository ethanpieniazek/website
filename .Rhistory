**R meets Python**
*During my last semester for my computational biology class I spend lots of time learning the fundamentals of R, the various packages that make calculating statistics/creating plots much more efficient, and how to showcase these skills with data scavenged from the real world. It turned out to be one of the coolest classes I have taken at UT as it taught me how to exhaust my resources in order to find the answer to the question at stake. I quickly found what I liked so much about coding in R being that one does not have to learn everything at once or even in any particular order. It is rather all about finding what you need for a particular project, implementing it, and then being able to access the information next time to help with other projects. As I kept messing around with R I kept learning more and more about how to troubleshoot future problems quicker and more efficiently. It was cool to find something that could keep me busy without getting distracted for hours on end until I found the solution.*

## **The Last Two Months**
*The past couple months have been very interesting to say the least. After spring break got extended an extra week, my buddy Robbie and I decided to extend our stay in Red Rock near Las Vegas another week to climb the sandstone. Halfway through the trip I received news that campus had been closed and all classes were to be moved remotely via Zoom. The official campsite right by Red Rock also shut down March 22nd due to the virus, so we decided to hold it out another week in an area a bit further away from Red Rock where we could dispersed camp and see if school was feasible on the road, using my car as my office/charging port and my phone as a hotspot. It ended up working out just fine even though there were many problems to figure out along the way. Some of these problems included where we were going to shower now that businesses were closed, where we would fill up water, where to efficiently buy groceries, and where to find better places to camp that were closer to Red Rock (which we eventually found due to word of mouth from other climbers). Staying in Las Vegas ended up being well worth it as all the classic lines people are often found waiting in line for or even worse 'congalining' were all empty since the Red Rock Scenic Loop that makes the conservation area easily accessible was closed. Long approaches of up to 2 hours became the norm on days we climbed, but the reward was getting to an area that is often just too busy and having it completely vacant. It truly felt like a once in a lifetime experience and we are glad we stayed in Vegas until it got too hot to continue. We are currently at Mount Lemmon just outside of Tucson, Arizona. Even though Tucson has high temperatures this time of year, Mount Lemmon consistently stays around 30 degrees cooler. Cragging along the Catalina Highway has been great as the approaches are much shorter and we do not have to take our tent down every morning. Packing in all our water for the week in a sedan along with packing out all of our trash back to Tucson gets tricky sometimes, but we make it work with a couple trips to town every week. It is nice to climb on the different rock here being granite as limestone is practically all there is in Austin besides the pink granite domes at Enchanted Rock. Even though commencement got delayed it was cool this situation came from it as I would have never anticipated dirtbagging my last semester of college.*
