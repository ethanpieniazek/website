      <description>The Last Two Months The past couple months have been very interesting to say the least. After spring break got extended an extra week, my buddy Robbie and I decided to extend our stay in Red Rock near Las Vegas another week to climb the sandstone. Halfway through the trip I received news that campus had been closed and all classes were to be moved remotely via Zoom. The official campsite right by Red Rock also shut down March 22nd due to the virus, so we decided to hold it out another week in an area a bit further away from Red Rock where we could dispersed camp and see if school was feasible on the road, using my car as my office/charging port and my phone as a hotspot.</description>

      <description>After scouring for hours on Kaggle, spreadsheets, and data.gov for this project in search of two interesting datasets that could be related by a common variable, I ended up stumbling across some interesting stuff while not even actively searching. After reading that “Uncut Gems” had the seventh most f-bombs in movie history, I searched along these lines and found a table on wikipedia that was 144 observations long. The table included the name and year of the film, rank relative to one another concerning the total number of f-bombs, total f-bombs, total minutes, source, and f-bombs per minute.</description>
